#Create a program that receives the ten names that were drawn in the
#lady bingo. Knowing that bingo had ten prizes, inform
#Ms. Sueli, what was the first time she was drawn and how many times was her name
#he appeared. Considering that the ladies named Eneide and Nair were not there to
#receive the prize, the program also informs how many more draws should be
#made to complete the ten prizes.
