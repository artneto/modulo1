#Write a program that reads a value and displays the Fibonacci number corresponding 
# to this read value. Remember that the first 2 elements of the Fibonacci series are
#  0 and 1 and each next term is the sum of the 2 before it. All Fibonacci values calculated
#  in this problem must fit into an unsigned 64-bit integer.
